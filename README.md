# Waldo with TDD / Firebase BaaS

I will embrace/apply the TDD philosophy as well as the learnings from the Battleshipp TDD project I completed before moving into the React material. This project will also include a BaaS (Firebase/Firestore) to store the hit coordinates for each target to be queried by the frontend.
